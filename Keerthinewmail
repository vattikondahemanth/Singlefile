Subject: Need some numerical data on our recent project

Hi Deepthi,
	  Thank you very much for meeting with me yesterday regarding our project. I appreciate your assistance and insights on the project.
  I am looking forward to implementing many of your great suggestions in our project.
  
	  It was helpful to have someone who had experience with similar projects with whom I can discuss ways of fine-tuning and optimizing our process.
  Thanks for your contributions to this project and for taking time out of your busy schedule to meet me yesterday.
	
    I am actually in search of our premium users' data which I have to use for making a presentation to our business.
   I need this data before evening 4'0 clock so I can prepare the presentation and submit it to our business. 
  
	  I will be very grateful if you mail me this data at the earliest. Thank you in advance.

Regards,
Keerthi,
Team Lead (SAP).
